Arif Amiruddin is a recent graduate of Computer Networking and Security from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia. He is currently undergoing a Java training program sponsored by Yayasan Peneraju.

He found his passion for technology in 2013, when he first got his own laptop. Prior to entering university, he never saw himself as a future tech worker. However, his love of mathematics and problem-solving drew him to the field. He is inspired by the thought of creating innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on the world.

In his free time, Arif enjoys spending time with his family and friends, watching anime, and scrolling through Reddit.

He is grateful for the support of his teachers, lecturers, friends, and family during his amazing journey.
