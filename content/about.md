## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Arif Amiruddin is currently a student in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia. He is majoring in Computer Networking and Security.

Arif found his passion for technology in the year 2013, when he first got his own laptop. 

Prior to entering his education journey at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, he never saw himself as one day becoming a future tech worker. Arif loved mathematics as a child and has developed those skills as he got older in understanding algorithms and data structure. The thought of creating amazing works keeps inspiring me to keep going each day.

When Arif is not working, he is spending time with his family, friends, watching anime and scrolling through reddit.

Great appreciation and thanks to my teacher, lecturer, friend and my family for all the support I have gotten along the year of this amazing journey.
